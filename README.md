## Business Scenario
Adventure Works Cycles (AWC) is an international manufacturer and seller of bicycles and accessories. The company’s headquarters is located in Bothell, Washington, USA, and has 3 main regional sales offices in America, Europe, and the Pacific. AWC would like to expand its sales to its best customers, extending its product availability through an external website, while maintaining lower production costs. AWC sales mainly come from two sales channels, such as resellers and internet/online. There are three major product categories for AWC online sales namely bikes, clothing, and accessories & components. The core income for AWC is obtained by selling three main brands of bikes such as mountain bikes, road bikes, and touring bikes bicycles. An additional income is generated by selling cycling accessories such as bottles, caps, gloves, jerseys, and components namely bike racks, brake chains, handlebars, etc.

- On the top left visualizations, you can see that the sales contribution from bikes in retail stores is about 80%, while the balance of 20% is from the other 3 product categories namely clothing and accessories & components. This could be that when customers make their purchases at the retail store, they are attracted to or persuaded by retailers to purchase other related products together.

- On the right, you can see that more than 95% of internet total sales revenue came from bike sales. This shows that there are low sales in other product categories. Therefore, it is recommended that improvements be made to the online website to prompt customers to purchase other related products from different product categories, or more promotions such as bundling sales or purchase-with-purchase could be run periodically to increase revenue in the other categories via the Internet.

- On the bottom chart, you can see that NA online sales contribute only 15% to their total sales revenue, while Pacific is 85%. This could be attributed to different buying behavior and promotional techniques used in different regions. Thus, AWC could adopt any good technique used in the Pacific to increase internet revenue in North America. In addition, NA could also extend its product availability through external websites such as Bikesonline.com, Walmart.com, and Amazon.com to increase its product exposure and revenue in the internet channel.

Next, I will analyze the production locations.

From the top left visual, the revenue generated from online channels among the three regions is very close, within the range of between $9 and $11M. However, given the size of the N.A region, I believe there is room to grow the revenue if they can focus more on Marketing and promotional activities in America. 

The right visual shows that the cost-to-revenue ratio in N.A is very high at 97% which is not as profitable as compared to Pacific. AWC could consider expanding more business in the Pacific given the lower costs-to-revenue ratio to improve the overall company’s margin. 

Another factor could be due to higher manufacturing costs in N.A. As shown below, the vendors are located only in North America. The costs of raw materials, manpower, and freight costs in America are also higher compared to other countries such as China, India, and Taiwan. Therefore, I recommend that AWC outsource production to countries such as China, India, and Taiwan to lower costs. With a lower production cost, they could price their product more competitively which could potentially improve their overall sales revenue.

Lastly, I analyzed the internet customer's buying behavior. 

In the internet sales by age group visual, customers in the age range of 50 to 69 tend to purchase more products online. This could be because they are still in their healthy and active stage of life. Thus, pursuing an active lifestyle through cycling-related activities. Therefore, since the 40s are the youngest in their age group, AWC should make targeted promotions on them to increase product awareness and revenue.

In addition, the sales by category visual shows that customers in their 40s and above 80s tend to buy accessories along with their bikes. Thus, AWC should provide purchase-with-purchase promotions or bundle deals to increase sales in other product categories among all age groups.

On the right, I visualized the email promotion of age groups. Evidently, more than 50% of the customers did not subscribe to receiving promotions. Therefore, to increase AWC's product awareness and sales, AWC could constantly prompt customers to sign up for promotions. AWC could provide discount vouchers upon subscription and exclusive membership to entice more customers to subscribe to promotions.

In conclusion, I would recommend that AWC focus on the above actions to improve its revenue and margin.
